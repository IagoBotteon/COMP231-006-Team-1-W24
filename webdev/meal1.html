  <h2>Preparation:</h2>
  <ol>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the tofu cubes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the tofu to a plate.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the shallot, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot is translucent and starting to brown around the edges, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground cumin, red chile powder (or crushed red pepper flakes), and ground turmeric to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the unsweetened coconut cream, smooth natural peanut butter, and honey to the skillet. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk in ½ cup of water and the Diamond Crystal or kosher salt. Return the tofu to the skillet and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. Thin the sauce with up to ¼ cup of water if needed, stirring to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the fresh lime juice.</li>
        <li>Scatter cilantro leaves and thinly sliced jalapeños over the saucy tofu. Serve with steamed white rice and lime wedges.</li>
      </ol>
