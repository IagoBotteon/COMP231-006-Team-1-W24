    <h1>Meal 3: Texas-Style Chili</h1>
    
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Chili took off in Texas during the late 19th century when Mexican women known as the Chili Queens served it alongside tamales and enchiladas in San Antonio’s Plaza de Armas. Today, an authentic “Texas bowl of red” is just like the Queens’ version, with chunks of meat (not ground) and no beans or tomatoes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 dried New Mexican chiles</li>
        <li>2 dried pasilla chiles</li>
        <li>1 canned chipotle chile in adobo (use 1/2 for less heat)</li>
        <li>3 1/2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, as needed</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>3 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>Corn chips and sliced jalapeños, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stem and seed the dried chiles. Toast in a dry large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, turning, until pliable, about 2 minutes. Transfer the chiles to a bowl and cover with boiling water. Let sit until soft enough to puree, about 20 minutes. Drain the chiles and add to a blender along with the chipotle and 2 cups fresh water. Puree until smooth; set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toss the beef in a bowl with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Cook the bacon in the same pot used to toast the chiles over medium heat until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet. A thin film of fat should cover the bottom of the pot; if not, add a little vegetable oil. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the beef in batches and cook, turning, until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to the baking sheet with the bacon.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the cumin and oregano and stir until toasted, about 30 seconds. Add the beef broth, 3 cups water, the pureed chiles, browned beef and bacon and the brown sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, partially covered, stirring and scraping up the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the beef is tender and the liquid is thickened, 2 to 2 1/2 hours; add more water during the cooking process if the chili gets too thick.</li>
        <li>Stir the vinegar into the chili. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, vinegar or brown sugar, as needed. If the chili is too thick, add more water, a little at a time. Ladle the chili into bowls and top with corn chips and sliced jalapeños.</li>
    </ol>
